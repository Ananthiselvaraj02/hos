Inline HTML elements
HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the Mozilla Developer Network.

To bold text, use <strong>.
To italicize text, use <em>.
Abbreviations, like HTML should use <abbr>, with an optional title attribute for the full phrase.
Citations, like — Mark Otto, should use <cite>.
Deleted text should use <del> and inserted text should use <ins>.

Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.
